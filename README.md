## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows modern Python design principles with clean separation of concerns:

### Key Components

- **`EvolutionPipeline`**: Main orchestrator that manages the complete evolution cycle
- **`InitialStoryGenerator`**: Creates the first generation of stories from prompts
- **`NextBatchGenerator`**: Evolves top performers into improved variants
- **`TournamentRunner`**: Manages ELO tournaments for story ranking
- **`EloRankingSystem`**: Implements sophisticated ranking algorithm

## 📖 How It Works

The system follows a three-stage evolution cycle:

### 1. **Generate Initial Batch**
- Creates multiple stories from your prompt
- Uses configurable AI models (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)
- Assigns initial ELO ratings

### 2. **Run ELO Tournament**
- Stories compete in pairwise comparisons
- AI judges evaluate based on your rubric
- ELO ratings updated based on wins/losses

### 3. **Generate Next Batch**
- Top-performing stories selected
- Variants generated with improvements
- Process repeats for multiple generations

This iterative process evolves increasingly better writing over time.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Setup

Edit these key files:

- **`prompt.txt`** - Your writing prompt/theme
- **`rubric.txt`** - Judging criteria for evaluation
- **`config.json`** - System configuration

### API Keys Setup

The system supports multiple AI providers configured through `config.json`. The configuration maps models to providers and specifies which environment variables contain the API keys:

```json
{
  "llm_providers": {
    "openai": {
      "type": "openai",
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "api_key_env": "OPENAI_API_KEY"
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "type": "anthropic", 
      "api_key_env": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    },
    "deepinfra": {
      "type": "openai_compatible",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai",
      "api_key_env": "DEEPINFRA_API_KEY"
    },
    "deepseek": {
      "type": "openai_compatible",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key_env": "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
    },
    "gemini": {
      "type": "openai_compatible",
      "api_key_env": "GEMINI_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/"
    }
  },
  "model_provider_mapping": {
    "gpt-4": "openai",
    "gpt-3.5-turbo": "openai", 
    "claude-3-sonnet-20240229": "anthropic",
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct": "deepinfra",
    "deepseek-chat": "deepseek",
    "gemini-2.5-flash": "gemini"
  }
}
```

Then set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"        # For GPT models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"  # For Claude models  
export DEEPINFRA_API_KEY="your-deepinfra-key"  # For Llama models
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-deepseek-key"    # For DeepSeek models
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"          # For Gemini models
```

You only need to set keys for the providers you plan to use. The system automatically routes model requests to the correct provider based on the configuration.

### Configuration Options

The `config.json` file controls all system behavior:

```json
{
  "batch_generation": {
    "num_stories": 10,
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "initial_elo": 1500
  },
  "elo_ranking": {
    "tournament_rounds": 50,
    "judge_model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    "k_factor": 32
  },
  "next_batch_generation": {
    "top_stories_to_select": 3,
    "variants_per_story": 2,
    "include_original_stories": true
  },
  "evolution_pipeline": {
    "max_iterations": 5,
    "auto_continue_from_existing": true
  }
}
```

## 🎭 Writing Modes

### Creative Writing Mode (Default)
- Focuses on storytelling, character development, and narrative techniques
- Uses mission-based generation strategies
- Optimizes for creativity and engagement

### General Writing Mode (`--general`)
- Focuses on academic papers, essays, reports, and professional writing
- Uses analytical and structured approaches
- Optimizes for clarity and persuasiveness

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Generation Strategies

For advanced users, you can customize the generation prompts, author styles, and mission sets by editing the files in the `src/generators/` directory:

#### Creative Writing Customization (`src/generators/generate_response.py`)

**Mission Sets** - Define creative approaches and goals:
```python
mission_sets = {
    "emotional_depth": [
        "Focus on the psychological depth of characters",
        "Explore complex emotional landscapes", 
        "Create moments of genuine human connection"
    ],
    "narrative_craft": [
        "Experiment with unique narrative structures",
        "Use vivid, sensory descriptions",
        "Create compelling story arcs"
    ],
    "dialogue_mastery": [
        "Write authentic, character-specific dialogue",
        "Use subtext and implied meaning",
        "Balance dialogue with action and description"
    ]
}
```

**Author Styles** - Emulate different writing approaches:
```python
author_styles = [
    "Write with the psychological insight of Virginia Woolf",
    "Adopt the sparse, powerful prose of Ernest Hemingway", 
    "Use the magical realism style of Gabriel García Márquez",
    "Employ the detailed world-building of Tolkien"
]
```

#### General Writing Customization (`src/generators/generate_response_general.py`)

**Academic Focus Areas** - Target specific writing domains:
```python
academic_focuses = [
    "Rigorous analytical argument development",
    "Clear thesis statement and supporting evidence",
    "Proper academic citation and source integration",
    "Logical flow and coherent structure"
]
```

**Writing Approaches** - Define analytical strategies:
```python
writing_approaches = [
    "Comparative analysis with multiple perspectives",
    "Problem-solution framework with evidence",
    "Cause-and-effect reasoning with examples",
    "Critical evaluation with balanced arguments"
]
```

### Customizing Judge Criteria (`src/generators/judge_response.py`)

You can modify the judging criteria and evaluation prompts to focus on specific aspects of writing quality:

```python
# Edit the judge_responses function to customize evaluation criteria
evaluation_criteria = [
    "Technical writing proficiency",
    "Creative originality and innovation", 
    "Emotional impact and reader engagement",
    "Structural coherence and flow",
    "Character development and authenticity"
]
```

### Tips for Advanced Configuration

1. **Backup Original Files**: Always keep copies of the original generator files before making changes
2. **Test Incrementally**: Make small changes and test with a few iterations before running full evolution cycles
3. **Monitor Results**: Use the web interface to validate that your customizations improve story quality
4. **Mix and Match**: Combine different mission sets and author styles for unique generation strategies
5. **Version Control**: Track your customizations with git to revert if needed

This modular approach allows you to fine-tune the evolution process for your specific writing goals and domains.

## 🌐 Web Interface

Validate your evolution results with the built-in web interface:

```bash
cd web_interface
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000 to access:

- **Story Comparison**: Side-by-side reading and preference selection
- **ELO Rankings**: View current standings and statistics
- **Evolution Tracking**: Validate that later generations improve
- **Data Export**: Download results for analysis
